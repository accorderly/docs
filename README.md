A data experimentation and model training framework. Reyearn aims to help people evolve machine learning models and inference engines in production by looping the pipeline lifecycle: ETL -> annotation -> training or tuning -> testing -> deploying. It is designed to be used with applications that take an ensemble-of-models approach.
